This project aims to provide a simple mechanism for paddy farmers, to gauge the change in water level of their paddy farms.

In concept, it uses a barometric pressure sensor to detect change in pressure, which is an indicator of change in water level. 
To achieve this the components necessary are very few, which are, an Arduino, visual indicators (LEDs), barometric pressure sensor (BMP180).
